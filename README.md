        * Slides effectively demonstrate the project 
        * Slides are clear and maintain audience interest

### Purpose
   
* We are utilizing everything we have learned about Python and Pandas on Jupyter Notebook to analyze data in order to get more detailed information about what the pulled data sources show.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Questions

* Do Average Home Value, Average Income, Average Household Education Level, and Public School Rankings by state have an impact on each other?
    * Median home value vs income(Madeline)
        * Observation: The T Test and graph show a correlation between Median home value and Average income. As The Median Home Value increases, the Average Income increases.
    * Median Home value vs education level(Shapoor)
    * Education levels vs income levels (Christina)
        * Income by Average Percentage of Graduates 
        The graph average income based on the percentage of graduates among the states. The lower percentage of people with graduate degrees in specific states represent a lower income level. The higher percentage of people with graduate degree represent a higher income percentage.
    * Zillow price vs house price(Molly)
        * Observation:  The Zillow home values are skewed and priced 200K more than the Median Home Value . 
    * Highest home value vs lowest (Molly)
        * Observation: Even though the homes in Hawaii cost more, their school quality ranking is not as good as West Virginia, where the homes are valued the lowest.
    * School safety vs school score and school rank (Madeline)
        * Observation: The school saftey ranking we can see have a correlation on the school quality and school score. As the school safety ranking increases, the school quality score increases, and the school score decreases overall. However, the T Test revealed that the school safety ranking has an impact on the school score but not the school quality ranking.
    * Median Home value vs public school score(Shapoor)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

* 

## Results

* What are two conclusions you can draw about the data?

* What questions do we still have?
